# Smart Wardrobe
This project aims to provide an intelligent solution for managing your wardrobe and generating outfits based on the clothes you own. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning, the Smart Wardrobe system can analyze uploaded clothing items, identify their characteristics, and store them in a digital wardrobe. It also utilizes an AI model to generate fashionable outfits using the available clothes.

## Features
* **Clothing Detection**: The Smart Wardrobe system uses computer vision techniques to identify various types of clothing items from images or uploaded photos.
* **Digital Wardrobe**: Once a clothing item is detected, it is saved in the digital wardrobe, which serves as a centralized inventory of your clothes.
* **Outfit Generation**: By leveraging an AI model, the Smart Wardrobe system can generate stylish outfits based on the available clothes in your digital wardrobe.
